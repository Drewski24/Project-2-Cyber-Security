        <h2>Intro to Cyber Security</h2>

        <p>
          Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and
          programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at
          assessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting
          money from users; or interrupting normal business processes.
        </p>

        <h2>The History of Cyber Security</h2>

        <p>
          Cybersecurity checking began in the 1970s when researcher Bob Thomas
          created a computer program called Creeper that could move across
          ARPANET's network. Ray Tomlinson, the innovator of email, wrote the
          program Reaper, which chased and deleted Creepers.
